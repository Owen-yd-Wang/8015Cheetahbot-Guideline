## Wiring

Wiring is considered as one of the most important parts in building the robot. If the wiring is efficient and steady, then there'll be much higher efficiency in repairing and overhauling and a much lower chance of disconnection or malfunction. In this document I would like to share some experience of wiring. 

#### Wire along edges and tubes (线沿边走)

Before wiring, we need to follow the edges of the robot. This would help to fix the wire to the aluminum tube with ribbons. What's more, it can save a lot of space in order to contain other parts or give path to other parts of the robot. 

E.g. 

#### Measure instead of instinct

Before cutting the wire, let it goes directly through the path it should go, and give **a $2\ mm$ margin** in order to keep it steady even if the robot is moving. Never Make the wires too tight! 

#### Go inside aluminum tubes

There's plenty of space wasted in the aluminum tubes, which could be utilized with wires. Letting wires go through the tubes can both protect the wire from being crushed into gears or roller chains and to give more space. Remember to design **extra holes** for wiring, usually a **diameter of $25\ mm$​​​ is enough** , otherwise it will be hard for wires to go through.
